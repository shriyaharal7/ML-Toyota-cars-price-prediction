# ML-Toyota-cars-price-prediction
Build a machine learning model to predict the sale price of a used automobile and deploy the best model.
 Implemented a Machine Learning regression model on an open-source dataset of Toyota cars having improper data for predicting the price of used Toyota cars.
 The main focus was on EDA, handling outliers, preprocessing the data, building various machine learning algorithms.
 Based on the accuracies of the algorithms, found the best algorithm with an accuracy of 93.9% for random forest tuned.
 Deployed random forest tuned model for real-time applications.
